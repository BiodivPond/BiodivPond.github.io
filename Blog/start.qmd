Freshwater ponds support up to [70% of Europe’s freshwater species](https://freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/habitats/ponds/), sustain bats and other terrestrial wildlife, and provide crucial ecosystem services such as [water purification and carbon storage](https://ponderful.eu). Yet, they are often overlooked in monitoring and conservation schemes due to their abundance, scattered distribution, and costly traditional surveys.

BiodivPond is a new Biodiversa+ pilot designed to fill this gap by combining environmental DNA (eDNA), passive acoustic monitoring, and citizen science. The pilot aims to:  
🌍 Create a transnational network for standardised pond monitoring across Europe.  
👩‍🔬 Involve local communities through citizen science, expanding coverage to hundreds of ponds.  
💾 Deliver open-access datasets and interactive tools for researchers, policy-makers, and conservation practitioners.  
✅ Provide high-resolution, actionable data to support [EU restoration and biodiversity goals](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/nature-restoration/).  

By testing scalable, multi-taxa, and innovative approaches, BiodivPond can demonstrate how small waterbodies contribute disproportionately to landscape-scale biodiversity. We can also prove how modern methods can make monitoring efficient, harmonised, and community-driven on a continental scale.
