**Deliverable 1: Biodiversity monitoring report and method evaluation**  
A comprehensive report summarising biodiversity observations (amphibians, fish, aquatic insects, and bats) across all ponds. Includes:
 – Comparison of eDNA, PAM, and traditional methods
 – Results of the *Triturus spp.* density estimation effort
 – Evaluation of the inter-lab quality check (ring test)
 – Recommendations for future use of these methods in routine biodiversity monitoring
 
**Deliverable 2: Citizen science guideline**  
A practical guideline for designing and managing citizen science schemes focused on pond biodiversity monitoring using eDNA. It outlines a modular participation model adapted to different volunteer profiles, data quality protocols, recruitment and retention strategies, and recommendations for digital infrastructure.

**Deliverable 3: *Triturus spp.* monitoring report**  
A short technical report summarising the results of the density estimation of *Triturus spp.* at core ponds. Includes insights into sampling effort, detection reliability via eDNA, and relevance for conservation status assessment.

**Deliverable 4: Core pond dataset**  
A curated dataset with harmonised, quality-checked biodiversity records from the 80 core ponds sampled by active contributors. Includes both eDNA and acoustic data, as well as metadata on habitat conditions and pressures.

**Deliverable 5: Citizen science pond dataset**  
A cleaned dataset containing biodiversity data collected from the 500 ponds sampled by the citizen scientists.
