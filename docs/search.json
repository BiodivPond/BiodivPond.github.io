The full title is “Biodiversity monitoring of ponds: evaluating the applicability of novel methods and identification of obstacles to wide use”.\nThe objectives of the BiodivPond pilot are:\n\nEstablish a transnational pond monitoring network across Europe: Each active contributor will sample a minimum of 6 ponds (80 in total) during late spring of 2026 for biodiversity and key local environmental pond conditions following a highly standardised sampling protocol based on traditional methods, eDNA and PAM, targeting amphibians, fish, aquatic macro-invertebrates, and bats.\nDesign and pilot a citizen science-based biodiversity monitoring scheme for ponds across Europe: All active contributors will collaborate in the development and implementation of a participatory citizen science-based monitoring scheme focusing on amphibians, fish and aquatic macro-invertebrates. The monitoring will follow a standardised field protocol to assess key local environmental pond conditions and to collect samples for the analysis of eDNA. A total of 500 additional ponds are located in different biogeographical regions throughout Europe.\nDeliver a shared open-access data infrastructure: A publicly accessible digital repository hosting all genomic (eDNA) and acoustic (PAM) data, including relevant metadata and species occurrence information, is operational by the project’s end, facilitating transparency and reproducibility.\nOperationalise data integration workflows: A tested and transferable pipeline enabling the integration of eDNA and PAM data into national and international biodiversity databases, and Europe-wide frameworks is in place and usable by all project partners.\nProvide user-friendly biodiversity visualisation tools: Interactive tools and dashboards displaying species presence and geographical distributions have been developed and made available to stakeholders, including nature managers, policymakers, and the public."

    "text": "Freshwater biodiversity is under increasing threat globally –⁠ particularly in Europe, where ecosystems face pressures from pollution, land-use intensification, habitat loss, and climate change. In response, EU member states are prioritising freshwater restoration.\nAmong freshwater habitats, ponds are especially valuable. Though small (typically 1 m² to 5 ha), they are the most numerous freshwater ecosystems on Earth and support a disproportionately high share of biodiversity,⁠ up to 70% of freshwater species in European landscapes. Ponds also sustain terrestrial species –⁠ including bats –⁠ and provide vital ecosystem services such as water purification and carbon storage.\nDespite their high importance, ponds remain largely neglected in EU water and nature strategies –⁠ including the Water Framework Directive –⁠ and are often missing from national monitoring scheme. This is largely due to their high number and scattered distribution, which makes traditional monitoring of ponds logistically demanding and costly.\nInnovative methods –⁠ including environmental DNA (eDNA) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) –⁠ offer scalable, cost-efficient alternatives. When combined with citizen science, these approaches enable high-resolution data collection while engaging local stakeholders, which is⁠ essential for long-term restoration success.\nThe BiodivPond pilot aims to integrate pond monitoring approaches into a harmonised European initiative. By combining eDNA, PAM, and citizen-science-based methods, it will support the development of standardised, effective biodiversity monitoring schemes. This effort will fill critical knowledge gaps and help achieve the targets of the Nature Restoration Law through better data on pond ecosystems across landscapes.\n\n\nBiodiversa+ is the European Biodiversity Partnership that supports excellent research on biodiversity with an impact on policy and society. Co-developed and launched in 2021 by BiodivERsA and the European Commission as part of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, it contributes to the ambition that by 2030, nature in Europe is on a path to recovery, and by 2050, people are living in harmony with nature.\nwww.biodiversa.eu"

Includes: – Comparison of eDNA, PAM, and traditional methods – Results of the Triturus cristatus density estimation effort – Evaluation of the inter-lab quality check (ring test) – Recommendations for future use of these methods in routine biodiversity monitoring\nDeliverable 2: Citizen science guideline\nA practical guideline for designing and managing citizen science schemes focused on pond biodiversity monitoring using eDNA. It outlines a modular participation model adapted to different volunteer profiles, data quality protocols, recruitment and retention strategies, and recommendations for digital infrastructure.\nDeliverable 3: Triturus cristatus s. l. monitoring report\nA short technical report summarising the results of the density estimation of T. cristatus at core ponds. Includes insights into sampling effort, detection reliability via eDNA, and relevance for conservation status assessment.\nDeliverable 4: Core pond dataset\nA curated dataset with harmonised, quality-checked biodiversity records from the 80 core ponds sampled by active contributors. Includes both eDNA and acoustic data, as well as metadata on habitat conditions and pressures.\nDeliverable 5: Citizen science pond dataset\nA cleaned dataset containing biodiversity data collected from the 500 ponds sampled by the citizen scientists."
