    "text": "Freshwater biodiversity is under increasing threat globally –⁠ particularly in Europe, where ecosystems face pressures from pollution, land-use intensification, habitat loss, and climate change. In response, EU member states are prioritising freshwater restoration.\nAmong freshwater habitats, ponds are especially valuable. Though small (typically 1 m² to 5 ha), they are the most numerous freshwater ecosystems on Earth and support a disproportionately high share of biodiversity,⁠ up to 70% of freshwater species in European landscapes. Ponds also sustain terrestrial species –⁠ including bats –⁠ and provide vital ecosystem services such as water purification and carbon storage.\nDespite their high importance, ponds remain largely neglected in EU water and nature strategies –⁠ including the Water Framework Directive –⁠ and are often missing from national monitoring scheme. This is largely due to their high number and scattered distribution, which makes traditional monitoring of ponds logistically demanding and costly.\nInnovative methods –⁠ including environmental DNA (eDNA) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) –⁠ offer scalable, cost-efficient alternatives. When combined with citizen science, these approaches enable high-resolution data collection while engaging local stakeholders, which is⁠ essential for long-term restoration success.\nThe BiodivPond pilot aims to integrate pond monitoring approaches into a harmonised European initiative. By combining eDNA, PAM, and citizen-science-based methods, it will support the development of standardised, effective biodiversity monitoring schemes. This effort will fill critical knowledge gaps and help achieve the targets of the Nature Restoration Law through better data on pond ecosystems across landscapes.\n\n\nBiodiversa+ is the European Biodiversity Partnership that supports excellent research on biodiversity with an impact on policy and society. Co-developed and launched in 2021 by BiodivERsA and the European Commission as part of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, it contributes to the ambition that by 2030, nature in Europe is on a path to recovery, and by 2050, people are living in harmony with nature.\nwww.biodiversa.eu"

    "text": "The 2025 seminar focused on the critical intersection of amphibian conservation, disease management, and the practical revitalization of wetland ecosystems in the Czech Republic.\nA primary concern addressed was the threat of pathogens, specifically the “salamander plague” (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans or Bsal). While the Czech Republic remains Bsal-free as of early 2025, the infection is spreading in neighboring Germany. Experts emphasized the urgent need for passive monitoring, strict biosecurity, and cooperation between veterinary authorities and nature conservation agencies to prevent an outbreak among local salamanders and newts.\nSpecies-specific conservation was also highlighted, particularly regarding the Natterjack toad (Epidalea calamita). An update to its conservation principles is currently underway, involving broad stakeholder cooperation to address threats such as predation and chytridiomycosis.\nSignificant attention was paid to infrastructure and road ecology. Amphibians constitute over 80% of road mortality statistics. The consensus suggests that investing in widespread, cost-effective barrier solutions is more beneficial for local populations (such as the Common Toad) than constructing a limited number of high-tech, expensive barriers. Insights from international research further revealed that newts utilize road underpasses more frequently than frogs, especially during autumn migrations.\nThe seminar provided a critical look at wetland management and revitalization. Preliminary results from South Moravia criticized past practices where pond creation often destroyed specific soil structures or failed to utilize the landscape’s revitalization potential. New guidelines now mandate stricter biological assessments to protect sensitive sites like salt marshes and peat soils. Conversely, successful case studies demonstrated how removing old agricultural drainage systems and creating pool cascades in sloping terrain can effectively restore water retention and biodiversity.\nFinally, methodological innovations were introduced. The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) was praised for its high detection efficiency (99% for Great Crested Newts) and utility in pathogen detection, though it is recommended as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, standard monitoring. Additionally, the assessment system for protected areas (EVL) is being transformed into a semi-automated process using revised indicators—such as water level fluctuation, fish pressure, and vegetation status—to provide continuous data on habitat health."

The pilot aims to:\n🌍 Create a transnational network for standardised pond monitoring across Europe.\n👩‍🔬 Involve local communities through citizen science, expanding coverage to hundreds of ponds.\n💾 Deliver open-access datasets and interactive tools for researchers, policy-makers, and conservation practitioners.\n✅ Provide high-resolution, actionable data to support EU restoration and biodiversity goals.\nBy testing scalable, multi-taxa, and innovative approaches, BiodivPond can demonstrate how small waterbodies contribute disproportionately to landscape-scale biodiversity. We can also prove how modern methods can make monitoring efficient, harmonised, and community-driven on a continental scale."
