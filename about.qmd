Freshwater biodiversity is under increasing threat globally (Reid et al., 2019) –⁠ particularly in Europe, where ecosystems face pressures from pollution, land-use intensification, habitat loss, and climate change (Zamora-Muñoz et al., 2024). In response, EU member states are prioritising freshwater restoration (EU, 2000; Regulation 2024/1991).

Among freshwater habitats, ponds are especially valuable. Though small (typically 1 m² to 5 ha –⁠ Richardson et al., 2022), they are the most numerous freshwater ecosystems on Earth and support a disproportionately high share of biodiversity,⁠ up to 70% of freshwater species in European landscapes (Williams et al., 2004; Biggs et al., 2017). Ponds also sustain terrestrial species –⁠ including bats –⁠ and provide vital ecosystem services such as water purification and carbon storage (Fehlinger et al., 2022; Holgerson & Raymond, 2016).
Despite their high importance, ponds remain largely neglected in EU water and nature strategies –⁠ including the Water Framework Directive –⁠ and are often missing from national monitoring schemes (Biggs et al., 2017; Vilmi et al., 2017). This is largely due to their high number and scattered distribution, which makes traditional monitoring of ponds logistically demanding and costly.

Innovative methods –⁠ including environmental DNA (eDNA) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) –⁠ offer scalable, cost-efficient alternatives. When combined with citizen science, these approaches enable high-resolution data collection while engaging local stakeholders, which is⁠ essential for long-term restoration success (Reid et al., 2019).

**The BiodivPond pilot aims to integrate pond monitoring approaches into a harmonised European initiative. By combining eDNA, PAM, and citizen-science-based methods, it will support the development of standardised, effective biodiversity monitoring schemes. This effort will fill critical knowledge gaps and help achieve the targets of the Nature Restoration Law through better data on pond ecosystems across landscapes.**
