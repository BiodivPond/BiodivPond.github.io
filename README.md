## 🐸 About BiodivPond
BiodivPond (Strengthening biodiversity monitoring in small water bodies) is a pan-European pilot project aimed at improving the monitoring of biodiversity in ponds. These small water bodies support up to 70% of freshwater biodiversity in European landscapes but are often overlooked in national monitoring schemes.

## Project Goals
Harmonize Monitoring: Develop standardized protocols for monitoring pond ecosystems across Europe.
Innovative Methods: Combine traditional field surveys with modern technologies like eDNA sampling and passive acoustic monitoring.
Citizen Science: Engage volunteers to sample hundreds of ponds, raising awareness and increasing data coverage.
Policy Support: Contribute data to support the EU Water Framework Directive and Water Resilience Strategy.
